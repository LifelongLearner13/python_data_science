##Python For Data Visualization

After taking an Introduction to Data Science class a few years ago, I wanted to explore the topics further on my own. The class I took focused on R, so I decided to use Python for my independent studies. This repository includes a variety of different visual representations, from bar graphs to maps. 

##Loading the Visualizations

I have included the graphical output of all the scripts in this repository. If you would like to run the scripts on your own computer you will need Python 3.5 and the following packages:
*[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
*[Matplot](http://matplotlib.org/)
*[Pygal](http://pygal.org/en/stable/)
*[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
*[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)

##Slides

The slides were used for a presentation to my [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/learn/) BootCamp Cohort
